            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p> Hello! My name is Andrew and this is my first website. The purpose of creating this website is to 
                get some hands on experience in web-dev and to become a better softare engineeer in general. The goal is to 
                learn incrementally via course such as the full-stack engineering path via codeacademy and cs50 web dev course 
                and then take what I learn and apply immediately to this website so that I can reinforce my learning.
